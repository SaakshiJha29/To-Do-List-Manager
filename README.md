# To-Do-List-Manager
A console-based To-Do List Manager in C++ using a singly linked list. Add, view, mark, and delete tasks dynamically with efficient memory use. Menu-driven, lightweight, and beginner-friendly, demonstrating core DSA concepts like pointers, traversal, and dynamic allocation.

Description

The To-Do List Manager enables users to:

Add new tasks

View all tasks or filter by status (pending/completed)

Mark tasks as completed

Delete tasks by ID or position

Each task is stored as a node containing the task title, description, and completion status, along with a pointer to the next task. The program follows a menu-driven approach, making it intuitive to navigate. All operations are implemented as modular functions for better code organization.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

üéØ Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

Linked list operations (insertion, deletion, traversal, search)

Pointer manipulation and dynamic memory management (new and delete)

Modular program design for maintainability

Handling edge cases such as empty lists or invalid task inputs
